\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

Since the turn of the century, life sciences have been evolving
rapidly. Advances in data acquisition, storage and analysis technology have
allowed scientist to gather immense amounts of data and build complex models
from it~\cite{modsys}. These complicated models have brought people of various
backgrounds, such as physics, mathematics and computer science into the field
of biology.

One such field is network science, which
is often used to analyze different kinds of networks that appear in the various
subfields of modern biology, including ecology~\cite{proulx2005network}, systems
biology~\cite{barabasi2004network} and neuroscience~\cite{sporns2014contributions}.

Metabolic networks~\cite{jeong2000large} are used to model the meta-bolisms of
various organisms. They are usually represented with a bipartite graph composed
of two types of vertices: reactions and chemicals produced and consumed by the
reactions. The edges in such a network connect chemicals to
reactions. Furthermore, the edges are directed indicating whether the chemical
was produced or consumed. A third kind of vertex can be added to represent
enzymes that catalyze the reaction, but do not directly partake in
it. Other commonly used representations are simplified representations, where
one of the types of vertices is omitted~\cite{newman2010networks}.

In this article, we analyze the subsystems in a metabolic network of the Chinese
hamster ovary cell. We explore different methods of detecting the subsystems and
compare their structures, focusing on the Girvan-Newman
method~\cite{girvan2002community} and an approach based on network
motifs~\cite{benson2016higher}. We expect these algorithms to outperform other
commonly used community detection algorithms such as Louvain optimization or the
Clauset-Newman-Moore algorithm.

Jeong et. al.~\cite{jeong2000large} offer a general overview of the organization
and structure of metabolic networks. The authors compare the metabolic networks
of 43 different organisms and find that metabolic networks belong to the class
of scale-free networks. Moreover, they find that the network diameter is
consistent across all of the analyzed networks, irrespective of the number of
substrates found in the given species.

Holme et. al.~\cite{holme2003subnetwork} present a method to decompose metabolic
networks into subnetworks based on the global network structure. They use a
modified Girvan-Newman algorithm~\cite{girvan2002community} to construct a
hierarchical clustering tree. They argue that instead of looking at a particular
partitioning of a network, we should look at the hierarchical clustering tree as
whole, since well-defined subnetworks appear at different levels of the
hierarchy.

A framework for clustering networks based on higher order structures
(e.g. motifs) is introduced in~\cite{benson2016higher}. The authors of the
article present an algorithm that performs community detection by using three
node motifs. It works by cutting the network into communities in a way that
minimizes the ratio of the number of motifs cut to the number of nodes in
instances of the motif.

\section{Methods}
\label{sec:methods}

In this article, we analyse a metabolic network of the Chinese hamster
ovary (CHO) cell. The CHO cell is frequently used in biological and medical
research and in the production of biopharmaceuticals~\cite{chocons}.

We use a whole-cell metabolic network of the Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)
cell that was taken from the BiGG database~\cite{bigg,chocons}. The original
network contains 4,456 metabolites that take part in 6,663 reactions. The
reactions and metabolites are annotated with additional metadata, such as name,
subsystem, BiGG ID etc.

The network was simplified to a simple directed graph, where reactions are
represented with nodes. If one reaction produces a metabolite that is used by
another reaction, they are connected by an arc. This network has 6,663 nodes and
656,609 arcs. If we treat as an undirected network, it has 546,208 edges.

We use two commonly used network community detection algorithms, namely the
Louvain modularity optimization algorithm~\cite{blondel2008fast} and the
Clauset-Newman-Moore algorithm~\cite{clauset2004finding}, as the baseline and
compare them to motif-based clustering methods~\cite{benson2016higher}.

The motif-based clustering method, motif counting and the Clauset-Newman-Moore
algorithm were taken from the SNAP library~\cite{leskovec2016snap} and the
Louvain modularity optimization algorithm was taken from the NetworkX Python
library~\cite{networkx}.

\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}

The network has a very large connected component of 6,036 nodes, while the other
components are very small, as they are composed of at most four nodes. The
largest connected component contains a strongly connected component of 5,307
nodes, while the other nodes are isolated. These probably represent sources and
sinks of the meta-bolism.

The network appears to have a scale-free structure. Its in-degree, out-degree
and degree distributions are plotted in Figure~\ref{fig:dist}. Some commonly
used network properties are presented in Table~\ref{tab:metrics}. The clustering
coefficient is computed as

\begin{equation}
  \langle C \rangle = \frac{3 \times \mathrm{\# triangles}}{\mathrm{\# connected
  \ triplets}}\ .
\end{equation}

The effective diameter $E_{90}$ measures the maximum number of hops needed to
reach $90\%$ of the network~\cite{leskovec2007graph}.

The graph density is defined as

\begin{equation}
  \rho = \frac{|E|}{|V|(|V| - 1)}\ ,
\end{equation}

\noindent
where $|E|$ is the number of edges and $|V|$ is the number of vertices in the
directed network.

\begin{table}
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{l|l|l|l}
    $\langle C \rangle$ & $E_{90}$ & $\rho$ & $\langle k \rangle$ \\ \hline
    0.012 & 15 & 0.015 & 194.1
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{The clustering coefficient $\langle C\rangle$, effective diameter
    $E_{90}$, the density $\rho$ and the average degree $\langle k \rangle$ of
    the network.}
  \label{tab:metrics}
\end{table}

First, we count the appearances of all 13 directed three-node motifs in the
network. The significances~\cite{milo2002network} of each motif are presented in
the second row of table~\ref{tab:motifs}. The significances were calculated by
comparing the motif occurrences with ten instances of Erdős-Rény random graphs
of the same size and density.

The normalized mutual information scores of the motif based clustering approach
are listed in the last row of table~\ref{tab:motifs}. We have calculated these
scores by comparing the algorithm's results and the actual subsystems listed in
the network annotation. The results are not the best, but still much better than
the Louvain and the Clauset-Newman-Moore method, listed in
table~\ref{tab:others}. We partly attribute the quality of the results to the
fact that most biological networks tend to be noisy.

The results show that the motif M4 is the most overrepresented motif in the
network, while also being the motif that works best with clustering. The motif
is a fully connected triangle, which represents groups of tightly coupled
two-way chemical reactions. Another thing we see from the results is that
triangular motifs - motifs in which all three nodes are connected in some way -
tend work better with clustering than wedge shaped motifs. This is also probably
a consequence of tight coupling between the reactions that form a subsystem.

\emph{NOTE: we plan on also using Infomap and the Girvan-Newman algorithms, but
  it seems like they will take a few more days to compute.}
