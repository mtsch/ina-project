# Network analysis of metabolic subsystems

## Major comments

### TODO
Abstract: The abstract is well written, but I believe that the third sentence
should be extended to two or three sentences more precisely describing the
work. Also, write in present tense (there should be no "will"). This also
applies for other sections.

### TODO
Introduction: The introduction should precisely describe the methods used and
relate that to existing knowledge. What methods will be adopted (be precise)?
And why do the authors believe that they will give some meaningful results? What
kind of results?

### TODO
Related work: Seems to be missing since only the field of the work is described.

### TODO
Methods: So far this text has little value for the reader. Some preliminary
results should already be conducted in order to see what would make sense.

## Minor comments

### DONE
I would recommend changing the title to "Network analysis of metabolic
subsystems".

### DONE
Why are there superscripts next to authors names? Change the name of the faculty
to the official title in English (see other proposals). Remove text "the date
of..." and "PACS...".

### DONE
Introduction: "from it[5]" --> "from it [5]"

### DONE
Results: I would remove the subsection. Try to avoid future or past tense.

### TODO
Results: Provide a table with standard statistics of the networks and briefly
discuss them in the text. As I already mentioned, Figure 1 is unclear. Please
follow my earlier suggestions.

### DONE
Overall: The paper is not badly written, but many errors and typos remain
(e.g. "Resutls"). The authors should reread the paper.

### DONE
Add contact details (e-mails).
