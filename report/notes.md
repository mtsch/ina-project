### Network analysis of metabolic subsystems (80%)

Very nice improvement from last time! Please also do the remaining part on this
level. I only list some minor comments below regarding the presentation, but
please consider also my earlier comments that you have not yet managed.

#DONE
"...Clauset-Newman-Moore algorithm..." in the abstract.

#DONE
Use the term "community detection" in the last paragraph of Section 1 (before
you start talking about different algorithms).

#DONE
"2 Related work", "Jeong et al. [10] offer...", "Holme et al. [8] present" etc.

#DONE
"...subnetworks appear at different levels of the hierarchy."

#DONE
In Section 3, you should at least briefly introduce each of the methods used (do
not go too deep). Now they are only listed.

#DONE
You should also briefly introduce the measures used in Table 1. In particular,
how is directed clustering computed? I would recommend to give a formula for
each measure.

#DONE
Use \hline in Table 1, "...in Figure 1.", "...in Table 1.", "...with ten
instances...".

#DONE?
Redo Figure 1 as I have mentioned previously. Now it is really hard to see
anything here.

#TODO - obrazlo≈æitev zakaj Z in ne p
Would it be better to add also the p-values in Table 2? Maybe you can replace
the Z-scores with p-values.
